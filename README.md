# asm-bank-deposit-calculator
Bank deposit calculator created for MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator.

The program asks to enter the details of the deposit in the bank and the period of capitalisation of funds. It then calculates the amount of money that will be on your account after a given time, and the amount after each subsequent year.
